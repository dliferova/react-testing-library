# React Testing Library + Formik

This is a pet project that leverages [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing. The main focus of the testing is on a user registration form implemented using [Formik](https://formik.org/), a popular form management library for React.

## Features

- **User Registration Form:** The project includes a user registration form created with [Formik](https://formik.org/), providing a seamless experience for users to sign up.
- **Testing with React Testing Library:** Use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) to ensure the robustness and reliability of our application by thoroughly testing the user registration form.
- **Using Vitest:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) is a next generation testing framework powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). Vitest provide a simple and understandable syntax for writing tests, which simplifies the process of creating and maintaining tests.
- **Created with power of Ant Design:** For nice and simple designe was used [Ant Design 5.0](https://ant.design), which components were successfully integrated with Formik.
- **Validate Form with [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup)**
